## Because it is relevant

!!! Abstract

    "Because it is Relevant," delves into the interconnectedness of tools across various domains and their significance in software development.
    Using the "Magic Arm" from photography as an analogy, it underscores how abstract concepts and tools can seamlessly transfer between different domains.

    Transitioning to Wireshark, the talk highlights its extensive applications. Based on actual problems, the speaker illustrates Wireshark's practical uses,
    demonstrating its effectiveness in debugging protocols, handling TLS encryption, extracting crucial data, and enhancing software performance.

    In conclusion, the talk emphasizes Wireshark's capabilities in tandem with other network tools, encouraging audiences to venture beyond their immediate domain to explore diverse tools.

## Rust vs C++

!!! Abstract

    Having been a C++ developer for quite a while, I answerd the question of "Rust or C++"
    for myself a while ago. How I ended up learning and digging into Rust was quite random though,
    thefore this talk tries to be a teaser to incentivize people to look into the language.
