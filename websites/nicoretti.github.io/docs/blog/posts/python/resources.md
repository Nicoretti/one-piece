# The Learning Python Care Package

When I joined [exasol](https://www.exasol.com) in early 2022, I was hired as `The Python Guy` for my team.

Well, by now various people in my team started adopting Python (for various reasons), but I tell myself my convincing arguments are at least some part of it ;). Anyway, for a while, it felt like every couple of weeks someone else, be it a work team member or a private contact, was reaching out to me and asking for good resources regarding Python. To learn it and to improve on it.

So I started compiling a small list with resources which I can highly recommend and which are very valuable.

The resources are mainly for begginners and intermidate people, hopefully others still find a gem and and there.

Because I wanted to start blogging anyway, I thought this might be a good point to start. So let me share with all and hope it can help one or the other person too.



## **Book(s)**
  - [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008) (Best Python book in my humble opinion)
  - Fluent Python (New version)
    - Haven't read it yet, but the first edition was brilliant.
    - People which I recommended it too and already read the new one where giving me positve feedback about it
  - [pytest-book](https://pythontest.com/pytest-book/)

## **Online Courses**
  - [Austin Bingham](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/austin-bingham)
  - [Robert Smallshire](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/robert-smallshire)
