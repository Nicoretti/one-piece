# User Manual

## Core Beliefs
* By helping others to improve their skills and/or to learn something, everybody benefits
 
    `(They, the company they are working for, the projects they are working on, their colleagues, 
     the end users, their future employers/projects …)`
 
* Code Quality is key and should be enforced as automated as possible
* Simple is better than complex
* “Getting things done” is important but things are also “Done when they are done”.

## What I value in others
* Collaboration `(beeing a team player)`
* Transparency `(Direct and honest communication)`

## Preferred working style
* I work best as part of a small, team 3-5 people 
 
    !!! Note
 
        I worked well in other sizes too (10, 20, 50), but personaly I think 3-5 people are the most effective.

* I prefer my working place being remote by default, additionally having an office I can go to possible scenario

    !!! Note

        If the office is not near by, multiday office visits with over night stays work well for me too.

* I like to work on an powerful but lightweight notebook
 
    !!! Tip "Bias"

        The operating system of my working device must be unix based (ideally Linux or MacOsx).

## Conditions I like to work in

        in english to improve and keep my english skills sharp.

## What motivates me
