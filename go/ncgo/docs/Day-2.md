# Day 2 Training

* [Slices Intro](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro)
* [Testing Go Applications](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/go-create-test-applications/table-of-contents)
  * Note: Go test seem bot be quite noisy
  * Rating: Okisch good overview
* [Go By Exmple](golang-github-golangci-lint-1.x86_64)
  * Note: read and tried some examples
  * Rating: Great place to look for code snippets and learn
* [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world)

## Noteworthy
* Slice(s) 
  * Slicing half open range like python
  * Dangling e.g. file content if keeping a micro slice
* Testing
  * Testing & Profiling out of the box
  * No assertions
  * Tables Based Tests
  * Benchmarking support is quite nice
