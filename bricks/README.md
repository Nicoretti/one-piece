Is a set of tools to keep your files clean. It provides various small handy tools
to either fix or check for common irregularities which are very anoying esepcially
for developers (e.g. trailing whitespaces).

## Tools

- [x] **trailing**: remove or check for trailing whitespaces.
- [x] **timeout**: runs a command and terminates it if it is not exited before the timeout.

## Planed Tools

- [ ] **spaces**: replaces all tabs with spaces or checks if tabs are used for indentation.
- [ ] **seek**: skip/select only parts of a file (similar to `head` and `tail`).
- [ ] **mixed**: checks if the file uses mixed intendation (tabs and spaces).
- [ ] **inplace**:helper tool "execute" changes to a file "inplace".
